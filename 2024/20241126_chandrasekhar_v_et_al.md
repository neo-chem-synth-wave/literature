# Abstract
The COCONUT (COlleCtion of Open Natural prodUcTs) database was launched in 2021 as an aggregation of openly available natural product datasets and has been one of the biggest open natural product databases since.
Apart from the chemical structures of natural products, COCONUT contains information about names and synonyms, species and organism parts in which the natural product has been found, geographic information about where the respective sample has been collected and literature references, where available.
COCONUT is openly accessible at https://coconut.naturalproducts.net.
Users can search textual information and perform structure, substructure, and similarity searches.
The data in COCONUT are available for bulk download as SDF, CSV and a database dump.
The web application for accessing the data is open-source.
Here, we describe COCONUT 2.0, for which the web application has been completely rewritten, and the data have been newly assembled and extensively curated.
New features include data submissions by users and community curation facilitated in various ways.
