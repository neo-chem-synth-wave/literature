# Abstract
Chemical compound space refers to the vast set of all possible chemical compounds, estimated to contain 10^60 molecules. 
While intractable as a whole, modern machine learning (ML) is increasingly capable of accurately predicting molecular properties in important subsets. 
Here, we therefore engage in the ML-driven study of even larger reaction space. 
Central to chemistry as a science of transformations, this space contains all possible chemical reactions. 
As an important basis for ‘reactive’ ML, we establish a first-principles database (Rad-6) containing closed and open-shell organic molecules, along with an associated database of chemical reaction energies (Rad-6-RE). 
We show that the special topology of reaction spaces, with central hub molecules involved in multiple reactions, requires a modification of existing compound space ML-concepts. 
Showcased by the application to methane combustion, we demonstrate that the learned reaction energies offer a non-empirical route to rationally extract reduced reaction networks for detailed microkinetic analyses.
