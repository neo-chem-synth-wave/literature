# Abstract
This paper deals with the subject of synthetic methodology at two very different levels, and accordingly, it is divided into two parts.
The first is concerned mainly with the general methods by which the plan of a synthesis is derived, and the second part places emphasis on the operations which constitute the individual steps of a synthesis and on some specific recent developments in this field.
