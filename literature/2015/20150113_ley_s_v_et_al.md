# Abstract
Organic synthesis is changing; in a world where budgets are constrained and the environmental impacts of practice are scrutinized, it is increasingly recognized that the efficient use of human resource is just as important as material use.
New technologies and machines have found use as methods for transforming the way we work, addressing these issues encountered in research laboratories by enabling chemists to adopt a more holistic systems approach in their work.
Modern developments in this area promote a multidisciplinary approach and work is more efficient as a result.
This Review focuses on the concepts, procedures and methods that have far-reaching implications in the chemistry world.
Technologies have been grouped as topics of opportunity and their recent applications in innovative research laboratories are described.
