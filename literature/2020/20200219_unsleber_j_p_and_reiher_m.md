# Abstract
Modern computational chemistry has reached a stage at which massive exploration into chemical reaction space with unprecedented resolution with respect to the number of potentially relevant molecular structures has become possible.
Various algorithmic advances have shown that such structural screenings must and can be automated and routinely carried out.
This will replace the standard approach of manually studying a selected and restricted number of molecular structures for a chemical mechanism.
The complexity of the task has led to many different approaches.
However, all of them address the same general target, namely to produce a complete atomistic picture of the kinetics of a chemical process.
It is the purpose of this overview to categorize the problems that should be targeted and to identify the principal components and challenges of automated exploration machines so that the various existing approaches and future developments can be compared based on well-defined conceptual principles.
