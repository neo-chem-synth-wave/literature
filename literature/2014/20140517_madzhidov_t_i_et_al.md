# Abstract
An approach for the prediction of rate constants of chemical reactions, based on the representation of a chemical reaction as a condensed graph, has been tested on more than 1000 bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions with neutral nucleophiles in 38 solvents.
Molecular fragment descriptors, temperature, and solvent parameters characterizing solvation power have been used in the reaction modeling.
The obtained models ensure a good correlation between the predicted and experimental values; the corresponding deviations are comparable with interlaboratory measurement errors.
