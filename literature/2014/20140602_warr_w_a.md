# Abstract
This article is the text for a pedagogical lecture to be given at the Strasbourg Summer School in Chemoinformatics in June 2104.
It covers a very wide range of reaction topics including structure and reaction representation, reaction centers, atom-to-atom mapping, reaction retrieval systems, computer-aided synthesis design, retrosynthesis, reaction prediction and synthetic feasibility.
In the time available the coverage of each topic can only be cursory; the main usefulness of this article to the research community is the extensive bibliography.
