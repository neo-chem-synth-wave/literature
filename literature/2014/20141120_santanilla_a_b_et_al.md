# Abstract
When chemists synthesize compounds, the threshold for success is at least a milligram of product.
This has been true for decades—even though biochemical assays have long since descended into microgram territory—and results in part from the constraints of characterization methods.
Buitrago Santanilla et al. present an automated dosing and characterization protocol for optimizing chemical reaction conditions on the microgram scale.
This allowed them to screen numerous base and ligand combinations for catalytic C-N bond-forming reactions between complex pairs of compounds, in short supply, that resisted standard coupling conditions.
