# Abstract
A novel approach to empirical retrosynthetic analysis of computer-assisted synthesis design is proposed using the KOSP (Knowledge base-Oriented system for Synthesis Planning) system.
KOSP has four functions: (1) strategic site pattern perception, (2) precursor skeleton generation, (3) retrosynthetic scheme evaluation, and (4) retrosynthetic analysis termination.
This system is based on knowledge bases in which reactions are abstracted by structural and/or stereo characteristics of reaction sites and their environments.
This article describes the framework of KOSP and the results of its execution.
