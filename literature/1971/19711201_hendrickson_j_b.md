# Abstract
A system is offered for mathematical presentation of the structural and functional features of organic molecules and their interconversion reactions.
The system offers a logical structure for reaction classification which can be used either to catalog synthetically useful reactions (presently known or unknown) to establish all possible synthetic routes to given molecular sites.
It also provides for a simple linear notation both for structures and their interconversions, hence for synthetic sequences.
The system is oriented to use in the design of organic syntheses but is presumably applicable to other problems requiring a systematic view of organic structure and reactions.
