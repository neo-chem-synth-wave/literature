# Abstract
A general procedure has been developed for the analysis of bridged polycyclic molecular networks to identify those bond disconnections most apt to lead to synthetically accessible precursor structures.
This procedure has been implemented in LHASA-10, the Harvard program for computer-assisted synthetic analysis, and it has been utilized in various ways for goal generation to guide antithetic operations.
Examples are given to illustrate the use of the strategic bond method, its limitations, and possible refinement.
An evaluation of the method based upon a comparison with current synthetic practice is presented.
The techniques and strategies described herein are also relevant to human problem solving.
