# Abstract
Reaction additives are critical in dictating the outcomes of chemical processes making their effective screening vital for research.
Conventional high-throughput experimentation tools can screen multiple reaction components rapidly.
However, they are prohibitively expensive, which puts them out of reach for many research groups.
This work introduces a cost-effective alternative using Bayesian optimisation.
We consider a unique reaction screening scenario evaluating a set of 720 additives across four different reactions, aiming to maximise UV210 product area absorption.
The complexity of this setup challenges conventional methods for depicting reactions, such as one-hot encoding, rendering them inadequate.
This constraint forces us to move towards more suitable reaction representations.
We leverage a variety of molecular and reaction descriptors, initialisation strategies and Bayesian optimisation surrogate models and demonstrate convincing improvements over random search-inspired baselines.
Importantly, our approach is generalisable and not limited to chemical additives, but can be applied to achieve yield improvements in diverse cross-couplings or other reactions, potentially unlocking access to new chemical spaces that are of interest to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
