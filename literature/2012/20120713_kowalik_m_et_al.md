# Abstract
Finding a needle in a haystack: The number of possible synthetic pathways leading to the desired target of a synthesis can be astronomical (1,019 within five synthetic steps).
Algorithms are described that navigate through the entire known chemical-synthetic knowledge to identify optimal synthetic pathways.
Examples are provided to illustrate single-target optimization and parallel optimization of syntheses leading to multiple targets.
