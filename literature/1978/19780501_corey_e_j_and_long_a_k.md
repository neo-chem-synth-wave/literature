# Abstract
The Harvard program for computer-assisted synthetic analysis (LHASA) has been expanded to include a module which directs antithetic simplifications of olefinic target molecules.
The new modules employs a readily modifiable data base of C=C transforms (retroreactions) written in chemical English (CHMTRN).
Transforms are selected via a unique set matching process based on prescreen information extracted both from the target molecules and from the transform entries in the data table.
Each transform has access to a considerable amount of subgoal power and is thus capable of generating quite long and sophisticated sequences.
Several strategies, corresponding to effective plans for polyene synthesis, have been implemented.
A number of sample antithetic analyses are included, and future extensions are discussed.
