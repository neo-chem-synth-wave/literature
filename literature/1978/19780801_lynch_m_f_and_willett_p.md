# Abstract
An approximate structure-matching algorithm is described which rapidly identifies substructures common to the reactants and products of a chemical reaction.
The deletion of these features results in the identification of those parts of the reacting molecules that have been changed in the course of the reaction; at the same time it is possible to locate the reaction sites within their parent molecules so that substructural searches could be performed both for reacting and nonreacting features.
The procedure has been tested upon a sample file of 340 reactions, and intuitively reasonable analyses were obtained for 315 of them (92.6%); a detailed failure analysis is given.
Potential applications to computer-aided synthesis design and to the production of large files of chemical reactions are discussed.
