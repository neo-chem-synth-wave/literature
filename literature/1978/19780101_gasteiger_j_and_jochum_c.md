# Abstract
A computer program has been developed which automatically generates sequences of chemical reactions.
As reactions are treated quite formally, all conceivable reactions are obtained irrespective of whether they axe already known or are without precedence.
This program is especially useful for planning organic syntheses and fox generating the products of starting materials.
The system is in very active development but the present version can already serve as a tool for the chemist in studying problems of immediate interest.
Examples for applications are given to demonstrate the flexibility and performance of the program.
