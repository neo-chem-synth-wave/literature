# Abstract
Procedures are described for the generation by computer of a sequential series of functional group interchanges to enable the achievement of important antithetic goals.
This capacity, which has been implemented in the Harvard program for computer-assisted synthetic analysis, leads frequently to the automatic design of chemically reasonable multistep sequences.
Provision has been made for the overall conversion of one type of functional group to another with up to four individual synthetic steps.
However, the methods that are presented may be used to produce sequences of any depth.
The potential sequences for converting the functional group in the target molecule (subject group) to the desired functional group in a precursor (object group) are determined by a search procedure through a "sequence tree".
The search proceeds directly from the subject group at the tree top to the object group at lower levels in the tree.
In order to guide a choice between alternative routes, a rating is derived for each sequence depending on the synthetic utility of each transform in the sequence and the total length of the sequence.
