# Abstract
The Harvard program for computer-assisted synthetic analysis (LHASA) has been given the ability to identify those functional groups in a structure which will interfere with the effective operation of a synthetic reaction and also to discern whether or not those groups can be protected.
The program module (FGR) which is responsible for this function contains data on the level of reactivity of each functional group toward a large number and diversity of chemical reagents.
Functional groups are subclassified, when appropriate, according to the environmental features within a molecule which can affect group reactivity.
Further, functional groups are characterized either as protectable (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl) or unprotectable (e.g., nitro).
During the operation of the FGR program module, the transform evaluation process is conducted so that an examination is made of both the target (product) molecule and the precursor (reactant) molecule.
Current capabilities, limitations, and further extensions of this program module are outlined.
