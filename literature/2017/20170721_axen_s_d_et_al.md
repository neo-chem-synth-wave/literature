# Abstract
Statistical and machine learning approaches predict drug-to-target relationships from 2D small-molecule topology patterns.
One might expect 3D information to improve these calculations.
Here we apply the logic of the extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) to develop a rapid, alignment-invariant 3D representation of molecular conformers, the extended three-dimensional fingerprint (E3FP).
By integrating E3FP with the similarity ensemble approach (SEA), we achieve higher precision-recall performance relative to SEA with ECFP on ChEMBL20 and equivalent receiver operating characteristic performance.
We identify classes of molecules for which E3FP is a better predictor of similarity in bioactivity than is ECFP.
Finally, we report novel drug-to-target binding predictions inaccessible by 2D fingerprints and confirm three of them experimentally with ligand efficiencies from 0.442–0.637 kcal/mol/heavy atom.
