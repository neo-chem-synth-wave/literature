# Abstract
Retrosynthesis consists of recursively breaking down a target molecule to produce a synthesis route composed of readily accessible building blocks.
In recent years, computer-aided synthesis planning methods have allowed a greater exploration of potential synthesis routes, combining state-of-the-art machine-learning methods with chemical knowledge.
However, these methods are generally developed to produce individual routes from a singular product to a set of proposed building blocks and are not designed to leverage potential shared paths between targets.
These methods do not necessarily encompass real-world use cases in medicinal chemistry, where one seeks to synthesize sets of target compounds in a library mode, looking for maximal convergence into a shared retrosynthetic path going via advanced key intermediate compounds.
Using a graph-based processing pipeline, we explore Johnson & Johnson Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (J&J ELN) and publicly available datasets to identify complex routes with multiple target molecules sharing common intermediates, producing convergent synthesis routes.
We find that over 70% of all reactions are involved in convergent synthesis, covering over 80% of all projects in the case of J&J ELN data.
