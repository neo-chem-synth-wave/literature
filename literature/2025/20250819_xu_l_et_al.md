# Abstract
Artificial intelligence has transformed the field of precise organic synthesis.
Data-driven methods, including machine learning and deep learning, have shown great promise in predicting reaction performance and synthesis planning.
However, the inherent methodological divergence between numerical regression-driven reaction performance prediction and sequence generation-based synthesis planning creates formidable challenges in constructing a unified deep learning architecture.
Here we present RXNGraphormer, a framework to jointly address these tasks through a unified pre-training approach.
By synergizing graph neural networks for intramolecular pattern recognition with Transformer-based models for intermolecular interaction modelling, and training on 13 million reactions via a carefully designed strategy, RXNGraphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmark datasets for reactivity or selectivity prediction and forward-synthesis or retrosynthesis planning, as well as three external realistic datasets for reactivity and selectivity prediction.
Notably, the model generates chemically meaningful embeddings that spontaneously cluster reactions by type without explicit supervision.
This work bridges the critical gap between performance prediction and synthesis planning tasks in chemical AI, offering a versatile tool for accurate reaction prediction and synthesis design.
