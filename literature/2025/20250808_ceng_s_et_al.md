# Abstract
Natural products constitute a major class of small-molecule drugs, yet their biosynthetic complexity has posed significant challenges for rational engineering and scalable production.
Current retrosynthesis tools, which are mainly made for synthetic chemistry, have not been effective in predicting the enzyme reactions that occur in natural product biosynthesis.
This limitation makes it difficult to improve biosynthetic pathways or create new bioactive compounds.
To address this gap, we introduce graph-sequence enhanced transformer (GSETransformer), a framework that combines graph neural networks, which preserve molecular topology and stereochemistry, with sequence-based transformers to predict enzymatic transformations with high fidelity.
By leveraging this hybrid approach, GSETransformer will assist in accelerating the design-make-test-analyze cycle, facilitating more efficient biosynthetic pathway design.
Its potential applications extend beyond retrosynthesis, encompassing enzyme engineering, microbiome metabolite profiling, and sustainable bioproduction, making it a valuable tool for advancing computational biosynthesis and drug discovery.
