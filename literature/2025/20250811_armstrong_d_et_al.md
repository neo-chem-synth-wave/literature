# Abstract
Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has made significant strides in generating retrosynthetic pathways for simple molecules in a non-constrained fashion.
Recent work has introduced specialized bidirectional search algorithms to find synthesis pathways that incorporate pre-selected starting materials, tackling a specific formulation of the starting material-constrained problem.
In this work, we introduce a simple guided search—Tango*-which allows solving the starting material-constrained synthesis planning problem using an existing unidirectional search algorithm, Retro*.
We show that by optimising a single hyperparameter, Tango* outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and solve rate.
We also highlight the effectiveness of our computed node cost function in steering synthesis pathways.
