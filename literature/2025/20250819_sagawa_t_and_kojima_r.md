# Abstract
Accurate chemical reaction prediction is critical for reducing both cost and time in drug development.
This study introduces ReactionT5, a transformer-based chemical reaction foundation model pre-trained on the Open Reaction Databaseâ€”a large publicly available reaction dataset.
In benchmarks for product prediction, retrosynthesis, and yield prediction, ReactionT5 outperformed existing models.
Specifically, ReactionT5 achieved 97.5% accuracy in product prediction, 71.0% in retrosynthesis, and a coefficient of determination of 0.947 in yield prediction.
Remarkably, ReactionT5, when fine-tuned with only a limited dataset of reactions, achieved performance on par with models fine-tuned on the complete dataset.
Additionally, the visualization of ReactionT5 embeddings illustrates that the model successfully captures and represents the chemical reaction space, indicating effective learning of reaction properties.
