# Abstract
Predicting EC numbers for chemical reactions enables efficient enzymatic annotations for computer-aided synthesis planning.
However, conventional machine learning approaches encounter challenges due to data scarcity and class imbalance.
Here, we introduce CLAIRE (Contrastive Learning-based AnnotatIon for Reaction's EC), a novel framework leveraging contrastive learning, pre-trained language model-based reaction embeddings, and data augmentation to address these limitations.
CLAIRE achieved notable performance improvements, demonstrating weighted average F1 scores of 0.861 and 0.911 on the testing set (n=18,816) and an independent dataset (n=1,040) derived from yeast's metabolic model, respectively.
Remarkably, CLAIRE significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art model by 3.65 folds and 1.18 folds, respectively.
Its high accuracy positions CLAIRE as a promising tool for retrosynthesis planning, drug fate prediction, and synthetic biology applications.
