# Abstract
Chemical synthesis planning has considerably benefited from advances in the field of machine learning.
Neural networks can reliably and accurately predict reactions leading to a given, possibly complex, molecule.
In this work we focus on algorithms for assembling such predictions to a full synthesis plan that, starting from simple building blocks, produces a given target molecule, a procedure known as retrosynthesis.
Objective functions for this task are hard to define and context-specific.
In order to generate a diverse set of synthesis plans for chemists to select from, we capture the concept of diversity in a novel chemical diversity score (CDS).
Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the algorithm predominantly employed in this domain, Monte-Carlo Tree Search, with respect to diversity in terms of our score as well as time efficiency.
