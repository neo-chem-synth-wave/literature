# Abstract
Synthetic organic chemistry underpins several areas of chemistry, including drug discovery, chemical biology, materials science and engineering.
However, the execution of complex chemical syntheses in itself requires expert knowledge, usually acquired over many years of study and hands-on laboratory practice.
The development of technologies with potential to streamline and automate chemical synthesis is a half-century-old endeavour yet to be fulfilled.
Renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI), driven by improved computing power, data availability and algorithms, is overturning the limited success previously obtained.
In this Review, we discuss the recent impact of AI on different tasks of synthetic chemistry and dissect selected examples from the literature.
By examining the underlying concepts, we aim to demystify AI for bench chemists in order that they may embrace it as a tool rather than fear it as a competitor, spur future research by pinpointing the gaps in knowledge and delineate how chemical AI will run in the era of digital chemistry.
