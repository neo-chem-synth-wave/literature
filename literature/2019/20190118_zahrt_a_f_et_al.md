# Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis is widely used in chemical research and manufacturing to access just one of two possible mirror-image products.
Nonetheless, the process of tuning catalyst structure to optimize selectivity is still largely empirical.
Zahrt et al. present a framework for more efficient, predictive optimization.
As a proof of principle, they focused on a known coupling reaction of imines and thiols catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid compounds.
By modeling multiple conformations of more than 800 prospective catalysts, and then training machine-learning algorithms on a subset of experimental results, they achieved highly accurate predictions of enantioselectivities.
