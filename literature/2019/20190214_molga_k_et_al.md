# Abstract
The Bigger Picture

Although intelligent algorithms can now reliably design synthetic pathways leading to arbitrary targets, to date no methods are available to ensure that machine-designed syntheses are substantially different from prior approaches.
Developing such methods could not only boost the general synthetic creativity but also be of practical value, enabling navigation around syntheses protected by seemingly unbreakable patents.
Here, we describe a family of algorithms that can first identify the key disconnections underlying known and/or patented routes and then—by preserving the "key" bonds during in silico retrosynthetic planning—seek alternative, patent-evading syntheses, including those leading to blockbuster drugs.
Although such algorithms will help inventors of new drugs enumerate and preemptively patent large numbers of viable synthetic routes, ensuring that their products are safe from generic copies, they may also ultimately yield more efficient and economical syntheses of pharmaceuticals, driving costs down—meaning that once expensive and exclusive medications are more readily available to all.

Highlights

- Computer autonomously designs syntheses avoiding desired key disconnections.
- By doing so, it navigates around patent-protected syntheses of blockbuster drugs.
- The algorithm can be useful to both identify and prevent such patent "bypasses".

Summary

By keeping track of lists of specific bonds one wishes to preserve, a computer program is able to identify the key disconnections used in the patented syntheses and design synthetic routes that circumvent these approaches.
Here, we provide examples of computer-designed syntheses relevant to medicinal chemistry, in which the machine avoids "strategic" disconnections common to industrial patents and is forced to use different starting materials.
The ability of modern retrosynthetic planners to navigate around patented solutions may have significant implications for the ways in which intellectual property related to multistep syntheses is protected and/or challenged.
