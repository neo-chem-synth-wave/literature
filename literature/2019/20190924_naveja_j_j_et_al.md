# Abstract
Scaffold analysis of compound data sets has reemerged as a chemically interpretable alternative to machine learning for chemical space and structure–activity relationships analysis.
In this context, analog series-based scaffolds (ASBS) are synthetically relevant core structures that represent individual series of analogs.
As an extension to ASBS, we herein introduce the development of a general conceptual framework that considers all putative cores of molecules in a compound data set, thus softening the often applied "single molecule–single scaffold" correspondence.
A putative core is here defined as any substructure of a molecule complying with two basic rules: (a) the size of the core is a significant proportion of the whole molecule size and (b) the substructure can be reached from the original molecule through a succession of retrosynthesis rules.
Thereafter, a bipartite network consisting of molecules and cores can be constructed for a database of chemical structures.
Compounds linked to the same cores are considered analogs.
We present case studies illustrating the potential of the general framework.
The applications range from inter- and intra-core diversity analysis of compound data sets, structure–property relationships, and identification of analog series and ASBS.
The molecule–core network herein presented is a general methodology with multiple applications in scaffold analysis.
New statistical methods are envisioned that will be able to draw quantitative conclusions from these data.
The code to use the method presented in this work is freely available as an additional file.
Follow-up applications include analog searching and core structure–property relationships analyses.
