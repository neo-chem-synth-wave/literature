# Abstract
Chemists often discover reactions by applying catalysts to a series of simple compounds.
Tweaking those reactions to tolerate more structural complexity in pharmaceutical research is time-consuming.
Ahneman et al. report that machine learning can help.
Using a high-throughput data set, they trained a random forest algorithm to predict which specific palladium catalysts would best tolerate isoxazoles (cyclic structures with an N–O bond) during C–N bond formation.
The predictions also helped to guide analysis of the catalyst inhibition mechanism.
