# Abstract
Chemists engaged in reaction discovery tend to report outcomes involving a few, relatively simple reactants.
It remains a major challenge to fine-tune reported conditions when the reactants become more structurally complex, as often happens in pharmaceutical research.
Lin et al. developed a protocol for rapidly screening different catalytic conditions for Câ€“N coupling across a wide range of complex substrates.
The product detection scheme relies on mass spectrometry of nanomole-scale reaction mixtures without any need for intervening chromatography.
