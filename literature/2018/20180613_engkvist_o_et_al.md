# Abstract
Over the past few decades, various computational methods have become increasingly important for discovering and developing novel drugs.
Computational prediction of chemical reactions is a key part of an efficient drug discovery process.
In this review, we discuss important parts of this field, with a focus on utilizing reaction data to build predictive models, the existing programs for synthesis prediction, and usage of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) to explore chemical reactions.
We also outline potential future developments with an emphasis on pre-competitive collaboration opportunities.
