# Abstract
In this Backstory, Bartosz Grzybowski and co-workers narrate their long, long route to a computer program that, as described in more technical terms in their research article in this issue of Chem (http://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(18)30063-9), is finally capable of autonomous planning of synthetic routes that are subsequently proven to work in the laboratory.
