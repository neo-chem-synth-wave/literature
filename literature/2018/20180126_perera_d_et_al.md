# Abstract
Chemists charged with manufacturing pharmaceuticals have recently been exploring the efficiency advantages of continuous flow techniques.
Perera et al. now show that a flow apparatus can also accelerate reaction optimization earlier in the drug discovery process.
They modified a high-performance liquid chromatography system to screen a wide variety of solvent, ligand, and base combinations to optimize carbon-carbon bond formation.
Injecting stock solution aliquots of the catalyst and reactants into a carrier solvent stream let the authors vary the main solvent efficiently and scale up the optimal conditions for product isolation.
