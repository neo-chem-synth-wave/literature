# Abstract
A fast algorithm is described for the automatic perception of the topological characteristics of a given molecular structure which are of fundamental importance in organic synthesis planning and reaction prediction processes.
Sets of atoms and bonds bearing common characteristics are built from the connectivity table.
These are used to extract more complex information about the problem molecule.
From these sets a table is built in order to elucidate the most reactivity enhancing area of the molecule.
Using the table and the topological characteristics sets, an algorithm for the perception of all the functional groups is presented.
All the information plays an important role in the perception of the disconnection sites of a target molecule in synthesis design and reactive sites in reaction prediction processes.
