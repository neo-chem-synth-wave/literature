# Abstract
A crucial problem in planning a synthesis is the selection of protective groups for reactive functionality which would interfere with one or more steps in the sequence.
This paper describes computer programs designed to assist the chemist in selection of protective groups.
PROTECT is a stand-alone program which accesses a database of reactivities of 228 protective groups vs. 108 prototype reaction conditions.
Also described is an enhancement to the LHASA program for computer-assisted synthetic analysis which allows LHASA to post-process sequences it has generated, suggesting protective groups for functional groups found to be interfering to the reaction conditions for one or more steps in the synthetic schemes.
Examples of the operation of both programs are included.
