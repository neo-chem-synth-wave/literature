# Abstract
A minicomputer program (SYNGEN) is described which generates all variable syntheses for any target structure within defined constraints and without user interaction.
SYNGEN first dissects the skeleton to find all fully convergent bondsets which utilize available starting material skeletons found in (usually) only two successive levels of cuts.
Then for each such bondset the necessary functionality is generated to initiate successive constructions of each designated bond, from real starting materials to the target functionality.
The construction reactions are generated from mechanistic principles formulated in a generalized digital description and requiring no database library.
The output is displayed by a second program (SYNOUT) which allows examination and selection of the resulting routes.
Several examples are discussed showing actual syntheses reproduced as well as new routes equally short.
