# Abstract
New algorithms for the perception of rings, aromaticity, and tautomers were developed in conjunction with the CAMEO program for computer-assisted mechanistic evaluation of organic reactions.
Briefly, the algorithms contain the following steps: prune the molecule of side chains, find ring(s), subdivide each ring into structural units, sum the units' contributions for the Ï€-electron count, and determine whether tautomerization is possible.
A noteworthy aspect of the ring algorithm is that only rings belonging to the smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) are found.
Results for representative molecules are presented, and rules for determining the aromaticity/tautomer status of rings, especially heterocycles, are discussed.
