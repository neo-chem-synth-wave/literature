# Abstract
The estimation and use of synthetic accessibility in the drug discovery process is discussed.
A distinction is drawn between synthetic feasibility and accessibility and the practical uses of an accessibility score are examined.
Various techniques used in the estimation of accessibility are described and their utility and potential accuracy compared.
