# Abstract
We report a new method to assess protective groups (PGs) reactivity as a function of reaction conditions (catalyst, solvent) using raw reaction data.
It is based on an intuitive similarity principle for chemical reactions: similar reactions proceed under similar conditions.
Technically, reaction similarity can be assessed using the Condensed Graph of Reaction (CGR) approach representing an ensemble of reactants and products as a single molecular graph, i.e., as a pseudomolecule for which molecular descriptors or fingerprints can be calculated.
CGR-based in-house tools were used to process data for 142,111 catalytic hydrogenation reactions extracted from the Reaxys database.
Our results reveal some contradictions with famous Greeneâ€™s Reactivity Charts based on manual expert analysis.
Models developed in this study show high accuracy (ca. 90%) for predicting optimal experimental conditions of protective group deprotection.
