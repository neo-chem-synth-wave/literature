# Abstract
Machine learning (ML) and quantum mechanical (QM) methods can be used in two-way synergy to build chemical reaction expert systems.
The proposed ML approach identifies electron sources and sinks among reactants and then ranks all source–sink pairs.
This addresses a bottleneck of QM calculations by providing a prioritized list of mechanistic reaction steps.
QM modeling can then be used to compute the transition states and activation energies of the top-ranked reactions, providing additional or improved examples of ranked source–sink pairs.
Retraining the ML model closes the loop, producing more accurate predictions from a larger training set.
The approach is demonstrated in detail using a small set of organic radical reactions.
