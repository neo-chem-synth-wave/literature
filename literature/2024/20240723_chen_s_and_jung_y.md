# Abstract
Synthetic accessibility prediction is a task to estimate how easily a given molecule might be synthesizable in the laboratory, playing a crucial role in computer-aided molecular design.
Although synthesis planning programs can determine synthesis routes, their slow processing times make them impractical for large-scale molecule screening.
On the other hand, existing rapid synthesis accessibility estimation methods offer speed but typically lack integration with actual synthesis routes and building block information.
In this work, we introduce BR-SAScore, an enhanced version of SAScore that integrates the available building block information (B) and reaction knowledge (R) from synthesis planning programs into the scoring process.
In particular, we differentiate fragments inherent in building blocks and fragments to be derived from synthesis (reactions) when scoring synthetic accessibility.
Compared to existing methods, our experimental findings demonstrate that BR-SAScore offers more accurate and precise identification of a molecule's synthetic accessibility by the synthesis planning program with a fast calculation time.
Moreover, we illustrate how BR-SAScore provides chemically interpretable results, aligning with the capability of the synthesis planning program embedded with the same reaction knowledge and available building blocks.
