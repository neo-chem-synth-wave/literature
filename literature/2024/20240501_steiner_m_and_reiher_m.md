# Abstract
Autonomous reaction network exploration algorithms offer a systematic approach to explore mechanisms of complex chemical processes.
However, the resulting reaction networks are so vast that an exploration of all potentially accessible intermediates is computationally too demanding.
This renders brute-force explorations unfeasible, while explorations with completely pre-defined intermediates or hard-wired chemical constraints, such as element-specific coordination numbers, are not flexible enough for complex chemical systems.
Here, we introduce a STEERING WHEEL to guide an otherwise unbiased automated exploration.
The STEERING WHEEL algorithm is intuitive, generally applicable, and enables one to focus on specific regions of an emerging network.
It also allows for guiding automated data generation in the context of mechanism exploration, catalyst design, and other chemical optimization challenges.
The algorithm is demonstrated for reaction mechanism elucidation of transition metal catalysts.
We highlight how to explore catalytic cycles in a systematic and reproducible way.
The exploration objectives are fully adjustable, allowing one to harness the STEERING WHEEL for both structure-specific (accurate) calculations as well as for broad high-throughput screening of possible reaction intermediates.
