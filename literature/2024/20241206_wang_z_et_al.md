# Abstract
Computer-assisted synthesis planning has emerged as a valuable tool for organic synthesis.
Prediction of reaction conditions is crucial for applying the planned synthesis routes.
However, achieving diverse suggestions while ensuring the reasonableness of predictions remains an underexplored challenge.
In this study, we introduce an innovative method for forecasting reaction conditions using a combination of graph neural networks, reaction templates, and clustering algorithm.
Our method, trained on the refined USPTO dataset, excels with a top-3 accuracy of 63.48% in recalling the recorded conditions.
Moreover, when focusing solely on recalling reactions within the same cluster, the top-3 accuracy increases to 85.65%.
Finally, by applying the method to recently published molecule synthesis routes and achieving an 85.00% top-3 accuracy at the cluster level, we demonstrate our approach's capability to deliver reliable and diverse condition predictions.
