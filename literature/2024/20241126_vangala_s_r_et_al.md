# Abstract
With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to design diverse and novel molecules from previously unexplored chemical space.
However, a challenge for chemists is the synthesis of such molecules.
Recently, there have been attempts to develop AI models for retrosynthesis prediction, which rely on the availability of a high-quality training dataset.
In this work, we explore the suitability of large language models (LLMs) for extraction of high-quality chemical reaction data from patent documents.
A comparative study on the same set of patents from an earlier study showed that the proposed automated approach can enhance the current datasets by addition of 26% new reactions.
Several challenges were identified during reaction mining, and for some of them alternative solutions were proposed.
A detailed analysis was also performed wherein several wrong entries were identified in the previously curated dataset.
Reactions extracted using the proposed pipeline over a larger patent dataset can improve the accuracy and efficiency of synthesis prediction models in the future.
