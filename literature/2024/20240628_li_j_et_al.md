# Abstract
Computer-assisted synthesis planning has become increasingly important in drug discovery.
While deep-learning models have shown remarkable progress in achieving high accuracies for single-step retrosynthetic predictions, their performances in retrosynthetic route planning need to be checked.
This study compares the intricate single-step models with a straightforward template enumeration approach for retrosynthetic route planning on a real-world drug molecule data set.
Despite the superior single-step accuracy of advanced models, the template enumeration method with a heuristic-based retrosynthesis knowledge score was found to surpass them in efficiency in searching the reaction space, achieving a higher or comparable solve rate within the same time frame.
This counterintuitive result underscores the importance of efficiency and retrosynthesis knowledge in retrosynthesis route planning and suggests that future research should incorporate a simple template enumeration as a benchmark.
It also suggests that this simple yet effective strategy should be considered alongside more complex models to better cater to the practical needs of computer-assisted synthesis planning in drug discovery.
