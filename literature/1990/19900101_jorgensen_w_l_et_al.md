# Abstract
An interactive computer program, CAMEO, has been developed to predict products of organic reactions given the starting materials and conditions.
The analyses primarily feature mechanistic reasoning and have been extended to cover most of the major classes of organic reactions.
An important aspect of the project has been to clearly define the logic behind accurate prediction of products and to simultaneously search for organizing principles governing organic reactivity.
The current capabilities of the program are summarized in this review and illustrated with comparisons to reported experimental reaction sequences.
