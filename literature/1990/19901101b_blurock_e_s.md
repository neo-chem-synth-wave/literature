# Abstract
The RETROSYN system, a program (written in LISP) for retrosynthetic planning is introduced.
Emphasis is placed on its use of reaction classes.
The source of information for the reaction classes is a database of reactions (represented simply as a list of reactants and products), and a means by which this information can be extracted, organized, and then used in RETROSYN is elaborated.
The organization of the reaction classes involves establishing a hierarchy of classes and subclasses.
Further uses and organizations of reaction classes for use in synthetic analysis are given.
