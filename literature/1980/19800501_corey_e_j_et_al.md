# Abstract
One of the major fundamental problems in computer-assisted synthetic analysis is the development of methods for conducting goal-driven, deep (or long-range) search.
Among the many problems associated with this approach is the avoidance of unfruitful lines of analysis which not only slow the problem-solving process but inundate the user with an unacceptable number of possibilities.
Since chemists face similar difficulties during their attempts to plan syntheses, progress with the computer-assisted approach can provide perspective.
The newest developments in multistep analysis in the Harvard program LHASA are illustrated for the Robinson annulation search.
LHASA treats a target structure systematically, examining each of the 12 possible positions for an α,β-unsaturated ketone in each six-membered ring.
Sequences of retrosynthetic steps called "procedures" are applied to remove obstacles blocking performance of the key simplifying disconnection, the Robinson annulation transform.
A new technique for preevalution of these procedures is used to ensure that only the sequences most likely to succeed in the laboratory are actually displayed to the chemist.
Several chemical examples are shown.
