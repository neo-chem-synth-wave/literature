# Abstract
An interactive computer program, CAMEO, is being developed to predict the products of organic reactions given starting materials and conditions.
In contrast to earlier programs which use a large empirical data base of reaction tables, a highly mechanistic approach has been taken to reaction evaluation in CAMEO.
The mechanistic class that has been implemented first is base-catalyzed and nucleophilic chemistry.
Organizing principles have been established to oversee the competitions between proton-transfer, substitution, addition, and elimination reactions.
With these rules, a knowledge of electron pushing, and much automatically perceived information on structure, functionality, pKa levels, and nucleophilic and electrophilic sites, the program is able to make sophisticated, mechanistically sound predictions on the outcomes of organic reactions.
