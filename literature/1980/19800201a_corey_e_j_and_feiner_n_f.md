# Abstract
The importance of conformational prediction for six-membered ring systems in computer-assisted synthetic analysis is pointed out, and a novel and appropriate means whereby this capability has been achieved in the Harvard LHASA synthesis program is outlined.
In this paper the first-order conformational analysis is described.
This involves assignment of one or more well-defined preliminary conformational forms and flexibility designation to each six-membered ring system in the target molecule.
The structural constraints which form the basis for these assignments are enumerated, and their various effects are described in detail.
The computational method for assigning axial and equatorial labels to all stereoappendages of the six-membered rings, in a manner that leads to consistency with respect to both the structural constraints discovered and any input made by the chemist, is then detailed.
It will be seen that these procedures enable the ultimate semiquantitative prediction of conformation to be made; means for accomplishing this are presented in the accompanying paper.
