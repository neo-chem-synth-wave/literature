# Abstract
The description of a new semiquantitative computer-based method to be used in synthetic planning for the prediction of the conformation of six-membered ring systems is carried on in this paper through the final stages of assignment.
Starting with specific geometries for preliminary assignment (i.e., chair, half-chair, boat) which are deuced from the first stage of analysis, simple empirical procedures are applied to calculate approximate conformational destabilization energies of each of the preliminary (i.e., tentative) geometries.
These procedures are based upon consideration of the disposition of axial and equatorial appendages and do not rely on three-dimensional atomic coordinates.
The quantification of interatomic interactions depends on sets of appendage interaction values, the derivation of which is described.
Rules for identifying destabilizing interactions between appendages within the same ring and adjoining rings are given.
The destabilization energies so obtained lead to the final conformational decision.
Comparisons are made between the results of the present method and those obtained by more complex molecular mechanics calculations and by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
