# Abstract
A major problem in computer-assisted synthetic analysis is the development of techniques for long-range searches directed towards retrosynthetic simplification of a complex target.
The approach used in the Harvard program LHASA, combines multistep antithetic analysis with an efficient method for prescreening targets to eliminate less promising routes and to limit the number of precursors generated.
These techniques are illustrated for the halolactonization search in LHASA, and the method for preevalution of pathways is described in detail.
A number of chemical examples are included.
