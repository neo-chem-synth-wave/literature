# Abstract
Following the skeletal dissection of a target structure, functionality and reactions may be generated either retrosynthetically back from the target to the necessary starting materials or in the forward direction from catalogue starting materials up to the target skeleton with various functionality, to be altered to the target itself after skeletal construction.
The former represents the SYNGEN program; the latter is the FORWARD program described here.
The forward variation is important not only in being directed by available starting materials but also in solving the problem of deducing refunctionalization reactions as well as constructions.
