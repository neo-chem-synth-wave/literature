# Abstract
The formal program system RAIN is described.
It generates the conceivable reaction paths that join known educts with know products of a chemical reaction.
The reaction generator of this system is not based on known reactions but operates in a deductive manner.
It is guided by a small number of constraints that describe the maximum complexity of a reaction step and introduce rules for the constitutional features of the generated intermediates.
The chemical behavior of the elements considered is taken into account by means of transition tables representing the valence schemes and their allowed interconversions.
