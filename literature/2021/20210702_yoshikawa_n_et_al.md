# Abstract
Social media activity on a research article is considered to be an altmetric, a new measure to estimate research impact.
Demonstrating software on Twitter is a powerful way to attract attention from a larger audience.
Twitter integration of software can also lower the barriers to trying the tools and make it easier to save and share the output.
We present three case studies of Twitter bots for cheminformatics: retrosynthetic analysis, 3D molecule viewer, and 2D chemical structure editor.
These bots make software research more accessible to a broader range of people and facilitate the sharing of chemical knowledge, concepts, and ideas.
