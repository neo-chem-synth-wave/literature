# Abstract
A major extension has been made to the computer program (LHASA) being developed to assist chemists in synthetic analysis.
This extension allows the automatic processing of a target molecular structure in the antithetic (retrosynthetic) direction with a depth of search corresponding to as many as 15 steps to determine whether a goal of utilizing a specific important ring-forming process can be attained.
The method is described for the Diels-Alder transform (retroreaction), the first specific case to be implemented.
The search for applicable subgoals leading to the application of the Diels-Alder transform is directed by a binary search pattern represented in the form of a data table.
This table is constructed from a "chemical flow chart" which contains information regarding the modification of structural features by stepwise application of transforms to produce the kind of structural unit required for a valid direct application of the Diels-Alder transform.
The data table is derived by transcription of the chart into a special computer-readable language resembling "chemical english" which is easily intelligible to a chemist.
The binary search technique, which is applied exhaustively to generate as many synthetic pathways as possible, is very effective.
An illustration is given and a brief discussion is presented of other uses if this technique in synthetic analysis by machine.
The feasibility of binary-search look-ahead of up to 20 steps for the purpose of applying important transforms or strategies has been clearly demonstrated.
Finally, procedures are described for machine perception of stereorelationships in organic molecules so that synthetically significant stereochemical information can be made available to the program.
