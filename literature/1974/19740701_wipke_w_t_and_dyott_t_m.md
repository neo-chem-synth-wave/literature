# Abstract
An ordered-list representation of double bond and asymmetric carbon atom stereochemistry is described which facilitates machine manipulation and analysis.
Procedures have been developed and implemented to transform a three-dimensional structure or a two-dimensional structural diagram having wedged and hashed bonds into the ordered-list connection table, and to transform an ordered-list connection table into a stereochemically unambiguous structural diagram.
Stereochemical requirements and selection rules of reactions, or their inverse, transforms, are represented in ALCHEM, a machine-readable English-like language.
Algorithms are outlined for manipulating the ordered-list connection table of a target structure according to the selection rules of a given transform, producing all stereochemically correct synthetic precursors of that target.
From these results many types of problems involving stereochemistry are now amenable to computer analysis.
The described algorithms have been utilized in a computer program for the design of organic syntheses.
