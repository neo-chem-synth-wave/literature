# Abstract
A computer program has been developed which starts with an internal machine representation of a chemical structure composed of atom and bond tables and effectively perceives a variety of structural units and relationships to be used for synthetic analysis by machine.
Procedures are described for the recognition and storage of such synthetically significant information as functional groups, rings, and collections of certain types of atoms or bonds.
A variety of data organizations, for example arrays, binary sets, and linked lists, are utilized in the program.
