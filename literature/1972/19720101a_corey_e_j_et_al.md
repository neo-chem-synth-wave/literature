# Abstract
The application of computer graphics to input and output chemical structures is described.
The graphics program which has been developed for use in computer-assisted synthetic analysis allows a high degree of interaction between man and computer.
Details are given with regard to the performance of the graphics program, its organization, structure, and adaptation to a particular machine (Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1).
