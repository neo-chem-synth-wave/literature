# Abstract
Computer-assisted synthetic analysis requires a systematic method of recognizing rings in polycyclic structures.
This method should be generally applicable, fast, and should provide a concise description of the cyclic structure.
The approach that has been developed operates on an n-cyclic structure (containing as many as 2^n - 1 rings) to select a "synthetic subset" of rings which provide a concise but complete description.
The description is complete in the sense that any ring not in the "synthetic subset" can be generated by taking the logical exclusive or of the sets of bonds in rings which have been included in the "synthetic subset".
This subset is defined as the set of all rings which cannot be expressed as the exclusive or of smaller rings, plus any other rings not larger than six.
Algorithms for efficiently obtaining this "synthetic subset" have been developed, and results from applying these algorithms to a variety of ring networks ar presented.
