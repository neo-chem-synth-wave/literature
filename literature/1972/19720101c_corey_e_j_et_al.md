# Abstract
A classification of synthetic reactions is outlined which is suitable for use in a machine program to generate a tree of synthetic intermediates starting from a given target molecule.
The generation of a particular intermediate by the program involves the search of appropriate data tables of synthetic processes, the search being driven by the information obtained by machine perception of the parent structure and certain basic strategies.
Procedures have been developed for the evaluation of chemical interconversions which allow teh effective exclusion of invalid or naive structures.
The paper provides a view of the status of computer-assisted synthetic problem solving as of 1970.
