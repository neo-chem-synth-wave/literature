# Abstract
Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are a novel class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization.
Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching.
ECFPs were developed specifically for structureâˆ’activity modeling.
ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses.
While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.
