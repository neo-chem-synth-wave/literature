# Abstract
Design of complex organic syntheses is a task well suited to computer implementation.
For a molecule of moderate size the number of potential synthetic pathways is extremely large.
Furthermore, the number of useful laboratory reactions is growing explosively.
The LHASA program is a tool for synthetic chemists to aid in choosing the most reasonable routes to any desired molecule without exhaustive enumeration.
The basic structure of the program and the chemistry it employs are discussed giving special consideration to the strategies employed in selection of routes.
