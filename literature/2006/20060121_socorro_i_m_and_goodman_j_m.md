# Abstract
A program to predict organic reactions, ROBIA, has been developed.
It achieves reaction prediction on the basis of coded rules and molecular modeling calculations, generating possible transition states, intermediates, and products given the starting material and reaction conditions.
The program generates all possible reaction pathways, on the basis of the selected transformations within its database, and evaluates them selecting the most feasible ones.
The program has been successfully tested against several examples.
