# Abstract
The field of predictive chemistry relates to the development of models able to describe how molecules interact and react. 
It encompasses the long-standing task of computer-aided retrosynthesis, but is far more reaching and ambitious in its goals. 
In this review, we summarize several areas where predictive chemistry models hold the potential to accelerate the deployment, development, and discovery of organic reactions and advance synthetic chemistry.
