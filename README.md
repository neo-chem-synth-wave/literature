Welcome to the computer-assisted chemical synthesis **literature** research project !!!

Over the past decade, computer-assisted chemical synthesis has re-emerged as a prominent research subject.
Even though the idea of utilizing computers to assist chemical synthesis has existed for nearly as long as computers themselves, the inherent complexity repeatedly exceeded the available resources.
However, recent machine learning approaches have exhibited the potential to break this tendency.
While learning about such approaches may seem daunting at first, access to a concise and up-to-date overview of the state-of-the-art literature is the consensus foundation for furthering understanding and expertise, especially for novice researchers.
Consequently, the primary objective of the **Literature** research project is to systematically curate and facilitate access to relevant computer-assisted chemical synthesis literature.


## Utilization
The purpose of the [scripts](/scripts) directory is to illustrate how to utilize the available computer-assisted chemical synthesis literature.
The [generate_markdown_content](/scripts/generate_markdown_content.py) script can be utilized as follows:

```shell
python scripts/generate_markdown_content.py \
  --input_directory_path "../literature" \
  --markdown_content "timeline"
```

The [search_literature](/scripts/search_literature.py) script can be utilized as follows:

```shell
python scripts/search_literature.py \
  --input_directory_path "../literature" \
  --search_tags "single-step-retrosynthesis" "template-based"
```

All scripts are utilizing a base environment.
