Welcome to the computer-assisted chemical synthesis **literature** research project !!!


# Contribution Instructions
**Step 1.** Check out a new branch with an appropriate title.

**Step 2.** Add a new file(s) in the appropriate year directory.
If the appropriate year directory does not exist, please add it yourself.
Please add only officially published peer-reviewed literature. (_i.e._, conferences and journals)
Stick to the following file naming convention:
```
# One Author (Author Ęugene McAuthórśky):
yyyymmdd_mcauthorsky_a_e.md

# Two Authors (Author Ęugene McAuthórśky and Coauthor Oliver Bradshaw de Machine):
yyyymmdd_mcauthorsky_a_e_and_de_machine_c_o_b.md

# Three or More Authors (Author Ęugene McAuthórśky, Coauthor Oliver Bradshaw de Machine, and Mentor Complainson):
yyyymmdd_mcauthorsky_a_e_et_al.md
```

**Step 3.** Update the new file(s) according to the [instructions](0000/00001231_mcauthorsky_a_e_et_al.md).

**Step 4.** Once a reasonable number of entries are added (_e.g._, around ten for quicker reviews), please create a pull request for merging the branch, and assign a reviewer.

**Step 5.** After the branch is successfully merged, please delete the branch.

You can either modify the format of the [existing literature](notion_export_old_format) or add new entries, but please keep the literature relevant to computer-assisted chemical synthesis.
