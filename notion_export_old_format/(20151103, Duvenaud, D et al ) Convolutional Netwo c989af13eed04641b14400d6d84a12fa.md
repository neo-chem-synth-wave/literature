## Publication Abstract

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è We introduce a convolutional neural network that operates directly on graphs. These networks allow end-to-end learning of prediction pipelines whose inputs are graphs of arbitrary size and shape. The architecture we present generalizes standard molecular feature extraction methods based on circular fingerprints. We show that these data-driven features are more interpretable, and have better predictive performance on a variety of tasks.

This publication introduces a novel approach to constructing chemical compound fingerprint descriptors by delegating the aggregation and hashing of features to a graph neural network. The obtained results indicate advantages over the standard Morgan fingerprint descriptors. However, in today‚Äôs research climate where everything is more-or-less done using graph neural networks, this just seems as an unnecessary complication.
