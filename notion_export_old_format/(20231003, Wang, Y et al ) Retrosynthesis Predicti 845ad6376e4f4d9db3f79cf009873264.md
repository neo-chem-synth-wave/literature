## Publication Abstract

<aside>
ℹ️ Automating retrosynthesis with artificial intelligence expedites organic chemistry research in digital laboratories. However, most existing deep-learning approaches are hard to explain, like a “black box” with few insights. Here, we propose RetroExplainer, formulizing the retrosynthesis task into a molecular assembly process, containing several retrosynthetic actions guided by deep learning. To guarantee a robust performance of our model, we propose three units: a multi-sense and multi-scale Graph Transformer, structure-aware contrastive learning, and dynamic adaptive multi-task learning. The results on 12 large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RetroExplainer, which outperforms the state-of-the-art single-step retrosynthesis approaches. In addition, the molecular assembly process renders our model with good interpretability, allowing for transparent decision-making and quantitative attribution. When extended to multi-step retrosynthesis planning, RetroExplainer has identified 101 pathways, in which 86.9% of the single reactions correspond to those already reported in the literature. As a result, RetroExplainer is expected to offer valuable insights for reliable, high-throughput, and high-quality organic synthesis in drug development.
